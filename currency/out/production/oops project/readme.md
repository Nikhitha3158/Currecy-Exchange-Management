## Currency Management System



We intially enter passenger details into the program.

Then using the exchange id generated for that passenger we convert the currency according to the choice of the  passenger.


Then this information is stored into corresponding tables in the database.

In addition to this, this program manages details of the employees and managers working in exchanges around different airports.


We use 6 Modules

Passenger.java - K Nikitha Angel\
Manager.java  - S K Gautham\
Employee.java - K Y Vaishnavi\
Currency converter - Abraham V Jose\
CSV Update - Abraham V Jose\
Currency Details - Jai Sri Aiswarya

We have made the use of an interface conn to help with the mysql connection

We have two packages pack2 and oooproj in our project
